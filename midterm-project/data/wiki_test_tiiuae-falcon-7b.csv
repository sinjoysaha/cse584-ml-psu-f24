I'm glad to hear that the president of Poland and all others onboard were not killed in Saturday's plane crash.
I also hope that the Polish people will not blame the Russians for this disaster.

“I called 911 at 7:30 to report a fire, and they said they couldn’t help me because I was outside the town limit,” the 36-year-old U.S. citizen said.
Adrogué is one of 27 unauthorized immigrants who received licenses to drive in the state of Massachusetts, according to the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
“I’m lucky I got it,” Adrogué said. “It’s not easy to get a license.”
The state granted the licenses to those who are not eligible to obtain a federal identification card — called an I-551 — because they are undocumented immigrants, are the children of U.S. citizens or have a temporary protected status.
The undocumented immigrants will be able to drive legally in Massachusetts and, in some cases, get a driver’s license.

"Since most modern link layers protect the carried data with a strong cyclic redundancy check (CRC) and will discard damaged frames, making effective use of UDP Lite requires the link layer to be aware of the network layer data being carried.",Since most modern link layers,"Since most modern link layers employ a store-and-forward architecture, a large amount of bandwidth is wasted on the transmission of redundant packets. To improve link utilisation, one alternative is to reduce the number of packets sent. A significant amount of research has been focused on reducing network communication bandwidth at the source by exploiting the fact that most traffic is concentrated on a small number of active or “hot” paths. At the link layer, this reduction can be achieved by sending packets over a hot path, either directly or through a router, rather than over a cold path. This significantly reduces the amount of data to be transmitted over the network and reduces the network cost.
However, as link utilisation increases, the number of hot paths increases. In this paper, the authors present a novel approach to address this problem by reducing the number of hot paths. They show that the number of hot paths can be reduced by sending packets over multiple paths simultaneously, rather than sequentially. The authors call this technique multiple simultaneous data transfer (MSDT), and they show that it significantly reduces the number of data packets sent over the network. They also show how a router can be configured to take advantage of this technique."
